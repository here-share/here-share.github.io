The HereShare Manifesto

We believe that communication is a fundamental human right, and that it should not be subject to the whims of governments, corporations, or internet service providers. We believe that people should have the ability to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences freely, without fear of censorship or retribution.

To that end, we are proud to introduce HereShare, a new Wifi service that allows people to connect, share, and communicate with one another without the need for an internet connection. HereShare operates as a communications service provider, and individuals are solely responsible for the content they share. As a web service operator, HereShare benefits from the immunity from liability for user-generated content provided by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.

By using HereShare, users agree to waive any claims or liability against the people or companies that operate the platform. HereShare is designed to be a decentralized and uncensored platform for people to share messages, pictures, and classified postings. However, messages should not be urgent in nature, as it may be a number of days before someone next connects. If you need emergency assistance, you should instead call 911.

Users can upload their content to a specific access point, and anyone else who connects to that same location's access point can view, like, and interact with that content. HereShare is time-limited, and postings will expire after one month to keep the platform fresh and up-to-date.

HereShare is powered by solar energy, and availability may be limited to mostly around noon time plus or minus a few hours. This ensures that our platform is sustainable and eco-friendly, while still providing an essential service to people around the community.

HereShare is a platform that celebrates uniqueness and diversity. Our platform uses cookies and MAC addresses to ensure that each user's content is attributed to them. This allows users to express themselves freely and confidently.

At HereShare, we believe that everyone has something valuable to share, and that every voice should be heard. We are committed to creating a platform that empowers people to connect, share, and communicate without fear of censorship or retribution. Join us today and become part of the HereShare community.
